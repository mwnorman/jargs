                        Switch to LinkedHashMap so that options print in the
                          order in which they are added
                        Add support for optional arguments by creating a new
                          type of OptionValueParser that uses <java.lang.Void>
                          as its bound-type in OptionValueParser<T>
                        Support adding default value for an option
                        Support testing 'isFound()' for an option
                        move to JUnit4
                        fix printUsage() formatting:
                           add [] indication for optional args
                           add printUsage 'preAmble' and 'postScript' strings
                           indenting

Prerequisites
-------------
For each prerequisite, the version with which JArgs has been tested is given 
in parentheses.  Any version equal to or later than this should work.

Apache Ant (1.4.1), by The Apache Software Foundation, from
http://ant.apache.org/.  Ant is used to build JArgs, and to run its tests.

JUnit4, by Eric Gamma, et al, from http://www.junit.org/
JUnit is used to run the unit tests, and is not needed to run the library itself.

NB - the use of generics and @Override annotations on Interface-implementations
     means that Java SE 6 is required.

Installation
------------

To compile, package, and test the code, run

ant

Two jars are created, one called lib/jargs.jar, which contains the runtime
library, and one called lib/jargs-test.jar, which contains the unit tests and
the examples.  The Javadoc APIs are created in doc/api.

To use the library with your own code, simply ensure that lib/jargs.jar is on
the CLASSPATH.


Documentation
-------------

The main documentation is the detailed worked example in
src/jargs/examples/gnu/OptionTest.java, plus the generated API documentation
in doc/api/.
